## Week 2 Challenges!

First - if you haven't finished today's ToDo, give that a shot. Then tackle any of the challenges below!

+ Make Fwitter pretty! Check out the CSS resources for some help. 
+ We desperately need your help building an online store for our Flatiron Swag! Take a look at the Flatiron Swag lab in the HTML Forms section and start building out another project.
+ Check out the labs in the Ruby Labs section of Learn. 
+ A lot of Sinatra's magic comes from Rack - a ruby library for building web applications. It handles all of the HTTP requests going back and forth from our browser to the server. Check out Explore Rack lab in the HTML forms section to learn more about how Rack works and start getting under the hood of your Sinatra app.
