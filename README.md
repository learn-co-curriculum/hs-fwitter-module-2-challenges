## Week 2 Challenges!

First - if you haven't finished today's ToDo, give that a shot. Then tackle any of the challenges below!

+ Make Fwitter pretty! Check out the CSS resources for some help. 
+ Try adding a hidden input in your form that works with Rubyâ€™s DateTime feature to timestamp your tweet.
  * Hint - Using the Ruby `strftime` method will be helpful for saving the info in a nice display format.
+ Check out the Ruby Labs section of Ironboard. The labs are organized from easiest to hardest - so try them out from top to bottom.
+ A lot of Sinatra's magic comes from Rack - a ruby library for building web applications. It handles all of the HTTP requests going back and forth from our browser to the server. Check out Explore Rack lab in the HTML forms section to learn more about how Rack works and start getting under the hood of your Sinatra app.
