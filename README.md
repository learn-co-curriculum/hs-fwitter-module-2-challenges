+ Make Fwitter pretty! Check out the CSS resources for some help.
+ Check out the labs in the Ruby Labs section of Ironboard.
+ A lot of Sinatra's magic comes from Rack - a ruby library for building web applications. It handles all of the HTTP requests going back and forth from our browser to the server.
