## Week 2 Challenges!

+ Make Fwitter pretty! Check out the CSS resources for some help. 
+ Try adding an input to your tweets form, like a dropdown menu or checkbox with options for moods (similar to Facebook).
+ Try adding a hidden input that works with Rubyâ€™s DateTime feature to timestamp your tweet.
  * Hint - Using the Ruby `strftime` method will be helpful for saving the info in a nice display format.
+ A lot of Sinatra's magic comes from Rack - a ruby library for building web applications. It handles all of the HTTP requests going back and forth from our browser to the server. If you want to learn more about Rack and start getting under the hood of your Sinatra app check out the Explore Rack lab on Ironboard.
+ We desperately need your help building an online store for our Flatiron Swag! Take a look at the lab on Ironboard and start building out another project.
